Configuration
-------------

Large parts of the frontend are controlled settings loaded at run-time. The
configuration loading process consists of two stages. First, the configuration
location file is loaded. It contains information on where the configuration
values are fetched from. Then, the actual configuration is loaded from the
specified location.

The config location is stored in a small XML file. It has to contain a root
node, <configLocation>, with two child nodes, <type> and <url>. The content of
the <type> node specifies the method used to access the configuration. Valid
values are »xml« (values read from a plain XML file) and »xml-rpc« (values
fetched via XML-RPC calls). The <url> node stores the location of the
configuration data. If no full locator (with protocol prefix) is given, the URL
is regarded as relative to the main SWF path. See configLocation.template.xml
for an example file.

The configuration is essentially a simple key/value store for several predefined
keys. Currently, the frontend reads the following keys:
 - availableThemes: Array of paths (relative to the directory the main SWF
   resides in) pointing to the theme root directory (the directory containing
   the themeConfig.xml) for each available frontend theme.
 - defaultTheme: The theme loaded on application startup (see above).
 - drawingSize: Default display size for the entry drawings (length of one
   side in pixels).
 - entryPreloadLimit: Number of entries loaded loaded in advance (eager
   loading for entries on the next pages).
 - entryServiceType: Method used to load the guest book entries. Must be one of
   »local« (SharedObject storage on the client-side) or »xml-rpc« (server store
   accessed via XML-RPC).
 - entryServiceInfo: Information specific to each entry service used to
   determine the location to load the entries from. When using the SharedObject
   storage it is the name of the object, when using the XML-RPC storage, the URL
   of the resource.

An XML configuration file contains all the values as nodes below a <config> root
node. See config.template.xml for an example XML config file.

When using an XML-RPC configuration, the values are fetched from the specified
XML-RPC resource via the API specified for theBlackboard. Please see the XML-RPC
API documentation for details.
